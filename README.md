## üìÅ Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle - E-Commerce Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)

**Features**:
- `InvoiceNo`: Invoice number
- `StockCode`: Product/item code
- `Description`: Product description
- `Quantity`: Number of items purchased
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of purchase
- `UnitPrice`: Price per item
- `CustomerID`: Customer identification number
- `Country`: Country of the customer

## üîç SQL Tasks Performed

### ‚úÖ Basic Queries
- **Select all records**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM data;
  ```
- **Transactions from the United Kingdom**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM data
  WHERE Country = 'United Kingdom';
  ```

### ‚úÖ Aggregation & Grouping
- **Top 5 most sold products**
  ```sql
  SELECT Description, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalSold
  FROM data
  GROUP BY Description
  ORDER BY TotalSold DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  ```

- **Average Unit Price**
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) AS AveragePrice FROM data;
  ```

- **Total Revenue by Country**
  ```sql
  SELECT Country, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Revenue
  FROM data
  GROUP BY Country
  ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
  ```

### ‚úÖ Joins
- **Create customer table & join**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE customers (
      CustomerID VARCHAR(20),
      CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
  );

  INSERT INTO customers VALUES ('17850', 'John Doe'), ('13047', 'Jane Smith');

  SELECT e.InvoiceNo, e.Description, c.CustomerName
  FROM data e
  INNER JOIN customers c ON e.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;
  ```

### ‚úÖ Subqueries
- **Most expensive item**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM data
  WHERE UnitPrice = (
      SELECT MAX(UnitPrice) FROM data
  );
  ```

### ‚úÖ Views
- **Top selling products view**
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW TopSellingProducts AS
  SELECT Description, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalSold
  FROM data
  GROUP BY Description
  ORDER BY TotalSold DESC;
  
  SELECT * FROM TopSellingProducts LIMIT 10;
  ```

### ‚úÖ Index Optimization
- **Create indexes for performance**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_customer ON data(CustomerID);
  CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_date ON data(InvoiceDate);
  ```

### ‚úÖ Additional Insights
- **Top 10 customers by total spending**
  ```sql
  SELECT CustomerID, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSpent
  FROM data
  GROUP BY CustomerID
  ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

- **Number of unique customers per country**
  ```sql
  SELECT Country, COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS UniqueCustomers
  FROM data
  GROUP BY Country
  ORDER BY UniqueCustomers DESC;
  ```
